# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-22
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 26

## Overview

This prototype validates whether simple psychological variables (personality, capacities, resources) can produce emergent character behavior that feels human. We build bottom-up: entity classes first, then stores, then the activity-XP-skill loop, then UI visualization. The journey ends with a single character whose behavior emerges from underlying systems without diagnostic labels.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Project runs with MobX architecture that mirrors Unreal patterns
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INFR-01, INFR-02
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Project setup with Vite, React, MobX, Tailwind, DaisyUI
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md - Root store pattern with React Context integration
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md - Character entity class with observable properties and proof-of-concept UI

**Details:**
- Tailwind 4 CSS-first config via @plugin directive
- DaisyUI dark theme only - no theme switching
- ESLint 9 flat config with typescript-eslint strict presets
- Character class mirrors Unreal Actor pattern for portability
- 0-100 scale with 50 as average for personality/capacity traits

### Phase 2: Character Core
**Goal**: Character has personality, capacities, and resources that affect each other
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: PERS-01-05, CAPS-01-05, RSRC-01-05
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - Extend Resources to 9 types, create modifier utilities
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Create SimulationStore for time-based updates
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md - Add personality-to-resource modifiers and applyTickUpdate to Character
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md - Create visualization components (PersonalityRadar, CapacitiesRadar, ResourceGauge)
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md - CharacterPanel sidebar integration with human verification

**Details:**
- Linear personality-to-modifier scaling (0-100 -> -0.2 to +0.2)
- Stress inverted: 0=good, 100=bad (unlike other resources)
- Threshold-based modifiers: traits only affect resources when above/below 50
- Recharts for radar charts, DaisyUI radial-progress for gauges
- Resource color coding: 70+ success, 30-70 warning, <30 error

### Phase 3: Skills System
**Goal**: Skills exist in a dependency graph where prerequisites gate unlocking
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: SKIL-01-05, INFR-03
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Skill entity class with types and XP cost calculations
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md - SkillStore with DAG logic, domain XP, and unlock actions
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md - Skill data seeding and RootStore integration
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md - Skill tree visualization with domain tabs and human verification

**Details:**
- Escalating XP formula: 50 + (nextLevel - 1) * 25 for levels 1-5
- Kahn's algorithm for cycle detection in skill prerequisites
- 8 skills across 3 domains with cross-domain dependency (go-to-store)
- State-based CSS classes (opacity/grayscale for locked, ring for unlockable/mastered)
- Emoji icons for skill states (simplicity over icon library)

### Phase 4: Activities System
**Goal**: Player assigns activities that generate XP and drain resources based on character fit
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: ACTV-01-06, INFR-04
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Activity entity class and type definitions
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - ActivityStore with queue management and RootStore integration
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md - Sonner toast setup and SimulationStore tick integration
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md - Activity seed data (8 activities across domains)
- [x] 04-05-PLAN.md - ActivityCard and ActivityQueue UI components
- [x] 04-06-PLAN.md - ActivityPanel with domain tabs and human verification

**Details:**
- Polynomial mastery XP curve: 100 * (level+1)^1.5
- MIN_OVERSKUDD_TO_START = 20 as configurable constant
- Success probability from capacity ratio + mastery bonus (+5% per level)
- Failed activities: 50% mastery XP, 5-point overskudd/mood penalty
- Two-column layout: activity selection (left), queue display (right)

### Phase 5: Talents System
**Goal**: Player can select talents that modify the character's capabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: TLNT-01-03, INFR-05
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md - Talent entity class and type definitions
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md - TalentStore with weighted random selection and talent seed data
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md - TalentSelectionModal with pick-1-of-3 UI
- [x] 05-04-PLAN.md - TalentsPanel and talent effect integration with human verification

**Details:**
- Rarity weights: common=70, rare=25, epic=5 (totals 100 for probability)
- 500 XP threshold per domain triggers talent pick
- Cumulative weight algorithm for unbiased selection
- Native dialog showModal() for accessibility and backdrop management
- effectiveCapacities used for both display and gameplay calculations

### Phase 6: Integration & Observation
**Goal**: All systems work together to produce emergent behavior visible on dashboard
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: OBSV-01-04
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md - Balance config store and centralized Dev Tools panel
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md - Preset archetypes (6 Big Five extremes) and character selection
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md - Side-by-side comparison mode for emergence validation
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md - Clinical terminology audit and final verification

**Details:**
- Balance config centralized in BalanceConfigStore (runtime-only, not persisted)
- 6 archetypes use extreme trait values (10 or 90) for maximum observable contrast
- Map-based storage for multi-character support with active character pointer
- Clinical terminology audit pattern established for future enforcement
- DaisyUI tab-content requires interleaved structure (tab-active + tab-content pairs)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
None (all integer phases)

**Key Decisions:**
- React + MobX for prototypes (Faster than Unreal, OO pattern transfers well)
- Three-layer character model (traits/skills/talents separates innate, learned, chosen)
- Piaget-inspired skill dependencies (Creates diagnosis gameplay)
- Roguelike talent selection (Adds fun/spice without complexity)
- Bottom-up architecture (entities -> stores -> UI) for Unreal portability
- 0-100 scale with 50 as average for all traits

**Issues Resolved:**
- DaisyUI tab-content structure (requires interleaved tab+content pairs)
- Archetype selection not replacing active character (added replaceActiveCharacter method)
- Personality modifier strength not connected to balance config (wired in 06-04)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Full game loop (prototype validates systems only)
- Multiple patients (start with one to validate)
- Autonomous AI decisions (player assigns activities for now)
- Persistence/saving (prototype runs in memory)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Some balance parameters not yet tuned for optimal feel
- No automated testing (prototype-level quality)
- No error boundaries or production hardening
