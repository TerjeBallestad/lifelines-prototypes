## Phase Verification

| Phase | Name | Plans | Verification | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 7 | Primary Needs Foundation | 3/3 | VERIFICATION.md | ✓ PASSED |
| 8 | Derived Wellbeing | 4/4 | VERIFICATION.md | ✓ PASSED |
| 9 | Action Resources | 3/3 | 09-03-SUMMARY (human) | ✓ PASSED |
| 9.1 | Activity Difficulty | 3/3 | VERIFICATION.md → gaps closed in Phase 10 | ✓ PASSED |
| 10 | Activity-Need Integration | 5/5 | 10-05-SUMMARY (human) | ✓ PASSED |
| 10.1 | Remove v1.0 Resources | 3/3 | 10.1-03-SUMMARY (human) | ✓ PASSED |
| 11 | Autonomous AI | 4/4 | 11-04-SUMMARY (human) | ✓ PASSED |
| 12 | Tuning & Balance | 5/5 | VERIFICATION.md | ✓ PASSED |

### Phase 9.1 Gaps Resolution

Phase 9.1 VERIFICATION.md identified 3 gaps:
1. Difficulty → Cost integration missing
2. Personality → Difficulty integration missing
3. Resource gating by difficulty missing

**Resolution:** All gaps closed in Phase 10 (Activity-Need Integration). Human verification in 10-05-SUMMARY confirms:
- Difficulty affects resource costs (higher = more drain)
- Personality alignment modifies difficulty/costs
- Activity tooltips display estimated costs

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status:** FULLY CONNECTED

| Chain | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Needs → Mood → Overskudd (7→8→9) | ✓ CONNECTED | SimulationStore.tick() calls full update chain |
| Difficulty → ResourceCosts (9.1→10) | ✓ CONNECTED | Activity.getResourceCosts() uses getEffectiveDifficulty() |
| Activity Execution → Restoration/Drain (10) | ✓ CONNECTED | ActivityStore.applyResourceEffects() handles both |
| Utility AI → All Factors (11) | ✓ CONNECTED | 5 utility factors use needs, personality, resources, difficulty |
| Telemetry → All Data (12) | ✓ CONNECTED | TelemetryStore captures needs, derived, resources |

### Key Link Count

- **Connected exports:** 25+
- **Orphaned exports:** 0
- **Missing connections:** 0

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Steps Verified |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Autonomous Survival | ✓ COMPLETE | AI picks → executes → restores → picks next |
| Player Observation | ✓ COMPLETE | Needs, mood, overskudd, costs, decisions all visible |
| Balance Tuning | ✓ COMPLETE | Config → simulate → telemetry → compare → presets |

## Anti-Patterns

No anti-patterns found in v1.1 phases. All code is substantive with no TODO, FIXME, or placeholder patterns.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. All deferred items from earlier phases were resolved in subsequent phases.

## Human Verification Summary

Human verification completed for all 8 phases:

| Phase | Human Tests | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 7 | 6 tests (toggle, needs, decay, colors, critical, v1.0) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 8 | 5 tests (mood response, floor, purpose, nutrition, UI) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 9 | 5 tests (overskudd, introvert, extrovert, focus, willpower) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 9.1 | 5 tests (difficulty display, skill reduction, mastery, tooltip) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 10 | 7 tests (restoration, costs, skills, personality, tooltips, escape, cause-effect) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 10.1 | 5 tests (UI cleanup, needs display, activities, simulation, console) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 11 | 5 tests (evaluation, critical priority, variety, toggle, patterns) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
| 12 | 6 tests (traces, persistence, presets, 7-day survival, differentiation, no spam) | ✓ ALL PASSED |
