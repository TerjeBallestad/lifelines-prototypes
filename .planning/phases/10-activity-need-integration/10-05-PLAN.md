<objective>
Human verification checkpoint for Phase 10 Activity-Need Integration.

Purpose: Verify all success criteria from ROADMAP.md are met through manual testing before marking phase complete.

Output: Verified phase completion or identified issues for gap closure.

  <what-built>
Complete Activity-Need Integration system:
- Activities restore needs gradually during execution
- Resource costs scale with difficulty and personality alignment
- Escape valve reduces costs when patient is struggling
- Floating numbers show restoration progress
- Completion toasts summarize changes
- Activity cards show estimated costs in tooltips
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
Open browser to localhost:5173

**Test 1: Need Restoration (ACTV-01)**
1. Create a character with v1.1 needs enabled
2. Let needs decay (hunger should drop over time)
3. Queue "Rest" activity
4. Watch as Energy need restores gradually (not instantly)
5. Cancel activity mid-way - verify partial restoration kept

**Test 2: Difficulty-Scaled Costs (ACTV-02)**
1. Compare two activities: "Chat with Neighbor" (difficulty 2) vs "Visit the Store" (difficulty 4)
2. Check cost tooltips - Store should cost ~2x as much Overskudd
3. Improve skills for an activity (level up small-talk)
4. Verify effective difficulty decreases and costs decrease

**Test 3: Personality Alignment**
1. Create high Extraversion character (80+)
2. Check costs for "Chat with Neighbor" (social tag) - should show "Good fit"
3. Create low Extraversion character (20-)
4. Same activity should show higher costs / "Poor fit"
5. Check "Solo Hobby Time" - introvert should have lower costs

**Test 4: Escape Valve (ACTV-04)**
1. Let character's Hunger need drop below 20%
2. Queue any activity
3. Verify costs are reduced (should be ~50% of normal)
4. Restore hunger above 20%
5. Verify costs return to normal

**Test 5: UI Feedback**
1. Start an activity that restores needs
2. Watch for floating numbers (+Hunger, +Social, etc.)
3. Wait for activity to complete
4. Verify toast shows summary of changes

**Test 6: Cause-Effect Clarity**
1. With needs panel visible, queue "Chat with Neighbor"
2. Watch Social need bar increase during activity
3. Verify player can clearly see the cause (activity) and effect (need change)

Type "approved" if all tests pass.
Or describe any issues found for gap closure.

<verification>
Human verification of all Phase 10 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. Patient eating/socializing observably restores corresponding needs
2. Difficulty affects resource costs (higher = more drain)
3. Skill level reduces costs via difficulty
4. Personality alignment modifies difficulty/costs
5. Activity tooltips display estimated costs
6. Struggling patient (critical needs <20%) sees reduced costs
7. Player can observe clear cause-effect between activities and needs
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 7 Phase 10 success criteria verified by human testing
- No critical bugs or broken functionality
- Activity-need integration feels intuitive and visible
</success_criteria>

<output>
After verification:
- If approved: Create `.planning/phases/10-activity-need-integration/10-05-SUMMARY.md` with verification results
- If issues: Document issues for gap closure planning
</output>
