<objective>
Human verification of all Phase 9 success criteria to confirm action resources behave correctly.

Purpose: Validate that the action resources implementation matches design intent and provides clear feedback to players.
Output: Verified Phase 9 complete with all success criteria confirmed.

  <what-built>
Action Resources system with Overskudd, socialBattery, Focus, and Willpower computed from needs and personality.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`, open browser to localhost

2. **Enable v1.1 mode**: In DevTools panel, toggle "v1.1 Needs System" ON

3. **Start simulation**: Click Play to begin tick updates

4. **Verify SC1 - Overskudd responds to wellbeing**:
   - Observe initial Overskudd value in Action Resources section
   - Wait for needs to decay (especially Energy via fast simulation)
   - Verify Overskudd decreases as Mood/Energy/Purpose drop
   - Hover over Overskudd bar to see tooltip breakdown
   - Expected: Tooltip shows "Mood (X) + Energy (Y) + Purpose (Z) = Total"

5. **Verify SC2 - Introvert socialBattery behavior**:
   - Set Extraversion slider to LOW (25-30)
   - Verify "Introvert" badge appears near socialBattery
   - With no activity running (solo context), socialBattery should be charging/stable
   - Note: Full social activity testing is Phase 10, but baseline behavior should show charging

6. **Verify SC3 - Extrovert socialBattery behavior**:
   - Set Extraversion slider to HIGH (70-80)
   - Verify "Extrovert" badge appears
   - With no activity running (solo context), socialBattery should be draining slowly
   - Hover tooltip should indicate personality effect

7. **Verify SC4 - Focus depletes with concentration** (partial - full test in Phase 10):
   - Focus should show at or near 100% (full capacity)
   - Focus does NOT deplete passively - only concentration activities deplete it
   - Verify Focus bar displays correctly with teal color

8. **Verify SC5 - Willpower affects Overskudd**:
   - Observe both Willpower and Overskudd values
   - When Willpower is high, Overskudd should approach its target faster
   - This is subtle - mainly verify both resources are tracking correctly

9. **Verify UI quality**:
   - All four resources display in Action Resources section
   - Each has distinct color (not threshold-based like needs)
   - Values update smoothly without jarring jumps
   - Section is visually separated from Derived Wellbeing

Type "approved" if all success criteria pass, or describe specific issues found.

All 5 Phase 9 success criteria verified by human testing.

<success_criteria>
- SC1: Overskudd decreases when Mood, Energy, or Purpose are low
- SC2: Introvert loses socialBattery in social, regenerates alone (partial - baseline verified)
- SC3: Extrovert loses socialBattery alone, gains in social (partial - baseline verified)
- SC4: Focus displays correctly (full depletion test in Phase 10)
- SC5: Willpower affects Overskudd recovery rate (subtle but functional)
</success_criteria>
