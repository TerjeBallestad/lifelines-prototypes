<objective>
Create types and utility scoring functions for the autonomous AI system.

Purpose: Establish the foundational types and pure functions that compute utility scores for activity selection. These will be consumed by UtilityAIStore in Plan 02.

Output: Two new files - types/autonomy.ts with decision tracking types, and utils/utilityScoring.ts with scoring calculation functions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create autonomy types</name>
  <files>src/types/autonomy.ts</files>
  <action>
Create the autonomy types file with:

1. `UtilityFactors` interface (5 factors, all 0-100):
   - needUrgency: number — how badly needs require this activity
   - personalityFit: number — activity-personality alignment
   - resourceAvailability: number — can afford the activity
   - willpowerMatch: number — willpower comfortably exceeds difficulty
   - moodDelta: number — projected mood improvement from activity

2. `UtilityWeights` interface (must sum to 1.0):
   - need: number (default 0.30)
   - personality: number (default 0.20)
   - resource: number (default 0.15)
   - willpower: number (default 0.15)
   - mood: number (default 0.20)

3. `AIDecision` interface:
   - timestamp: number
   - activityId: string
   - activityName: string
   - topReason: string (e.g., "Eating because Hunger critical (12%)")
   - score: number
   - breakdown: UtilityFactors
   - topAlternatives: Array<{ activityId: string; activityName: string; score: number }>
   - criticalMode: boolean

4. `DecisionLog` type as Array<AIDecision> (last 5 decisions)

5. Export `DEFAULT_UTILITY_WEIGHTS` constant:
   ```typescript
   export const DEFAULT_UTILITY_WEIGHTS: UtilityWeights = {
     need: 0.30,
     personality: 0.20,
     resource: 0.15,
     willpower: 0.15,
     mood: 0.20,
   };
   ```

Use JSDoc comments for all types explaining their purpose.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create utility scoring functions</name>
  <files>src/utils/utilityScoring.ts</files>
  <action>
Create utility scoring functions following RESEARCH.md patterns:

1. `shouldOverrideToCriticalMode(character: Character): boolean`
   - Return true if hunger < 15 OR bladder < 15 OR energy < 15
   - These are the physiological needs that trigger survival override

2. `calculateNeedUrgency(activity: Activity, character: Character): number`
   - Return 0 if activity has no needEffects
   - For each need in activity.needEffects:
     - Get current need value from character.needs[needKey]
     - Calculate urgency using inverted sigmoid: high urgency when need is low
     - Use needToMoodCurve from curves.ts (invert the result)
     - Formula: urgency = 50 - needToMoodCurve(currentValue, 1.0, 2.5)
     - Weight by restoration amount (restoration / 10, assume max restore ~10)
   - Return average urgency across all needs affected (0-100 scale)

3. `calculateResourceAvailability(activity: Activity, character: Character): number`
   - Get resource costs via activity.getResourceCosts(character)
   - Calculate ratio for each resource: current / max(1, cost)
   - overskuddRatio = character.actionResources.overskudd / max(1, costs.overskudd)
   - willpowerRatio = character.actionResources.willpower / max(1, costs.willpower)
   - focusRatio = costs.focus > 0 ? character.actionResources.focus / costs.focus : 1.0
   - socialRatio = costs.socialBattery > 0 ? character.actionResources.socialBattery / costs.socialBattery : 1.0
   - Return average of ratios * 100, clamped to 0-100

4. `calculatePersonalityFitScore(activity: Activity, character: Character): number`
   - Use calculatePersonalityAlignment from personalityFit.ts
   - alignment.gainMultiplier is 0.6-1.4 range
   - Convert to 0-100: (gainMultiplier - 0.6) / 0.8 * 100
   - Clamp result to 0-100

5. `calculateWillpowerDifficultyMatch(activity: Activity, character: Character): number`
   - Get resource costs via activity.getResourceCosts(character)
   - Calculate how comfortably willpower exceeds the willpower cost
   - Formula:
     ```typescript
     const willpower = character.actionResources.willpower;
     const cost = costs.willpower;
     if (cost <= 0) return 100; // No willpower cost = easy match

     // Ratio of willpower to cost, scaled to 0-100
     // At ratio 1.0 (just enough) = 50 points
     // At ratio 2.0+ (comfortable margin) = 100 points
     // At ratio 0.5 (struggling) = 25 points
     const ratio = willpower / cost;
     return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, ratio * 50));
     ```
   - High score when patient has comfortable willpower margin over difficulty
   - Low score when patient would be pushing their limits

6. `calculateMoodDelta(activity: Activity, character: Character): number`
   - Estimate how much this activity would improve mood
   - For each need in activity.needEffects:
     - Get current need value
     - Calculate what the need would be after restoration (clamped to 100)
     - Use needToMoodCurve to get mood contribution before and after
     - Sum the deltas
   - Normalize to 0-100 scale:
     ```typescript
     // Max possible mood improvement is roughly 100 points (from all needs at 0 to all at 100)
     // Scale the actual delta to this range
     const normalizedDelta = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, totalMoodDelta * 2));
     return normalizedDelta;
     ```
   - High score for activities that would significantly boost mood
   - Low score for activities with minimal mood impact

7. `scoreInCriticalMode(activity: Activity, character: Character): number`
   - Calculate pure urgency score (no personality, no willpower match, no mood delta)
   - For each need in activity.needEffects where character.needs[need] < 15:
     - urgencyScore += restoration * (15 - currentNeedValue)
   - Return urgencyScore (not normalized - higher is better)

8. `calculateUtilityScore(activity: Activity, character: Character, weights: UtilityWeights, isCurrentActivity: boolean): { score: number; factors: UtilityFactors }`
   - Calculate all FIVE factors using above functions:
     - needUrgency = calculateNeedUrgency(activity, character)
     - personalityFit = calculatePersonalityFitScore(activity, character)
     - resourceAvailability = calculateResourceAvailability(activity, character)
     - willpowerMatch = calculateWillpowerDifficultyMatch(activity, character)
     - moodDelta = calculateMoodDelta(activity, character)
   - Compute weighted sum:
     ```typescript
     const score =
       needUrgency * weights.need +
       personalityFit * weights.personality +
       resourceAvailability * weights.resource +
       willpowerMatch * weights.willpower +
       moodDelta * weights.mood;
     ```
   - If isCurrentActivity, apply 25% hysteresis bonus (score *= 1.25)
   - Clamp final score to 0-100
   - Return both score and factors breakdown (all 5 factors)

Import types from './types' and entities. Use explicit type imports.
