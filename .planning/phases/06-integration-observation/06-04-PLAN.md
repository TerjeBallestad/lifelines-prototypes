<objective>
Polish UI and verify no clinical labels exist.

Purpose: Ensure the prototype meets OBSV-04 (no diagnostic labels) and has consistent UI polish. Final verification that emergence is visible without medicalization.

Output:
- Audit of all UI text confirming no clinical/DSM terms
- Minor polish for consistency (spacing, colors, typography)
- Human verification that emergence works as intended

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Clinical terminology audit</name>
  <files>src/components/*.tsx, src/data/*.ts</files>
  <action>
Audit all UI-facing text for clinical/DSM terminology. Per CONTEXT.md:
- Big Five trait names are ALLOWED (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- Descriptive language is ALLOWED ("feeling low", "anxious", "stressed")
- Clinical terms are NOT ALLOWED: depression, anxiety disorder, diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, disorder, clinical, DSM, pathological, mental illness

Search pattern (grep):
```bash
grep -rn "depression\|disorder\|diagnosis\|symptom\|treatment\|clinical\|DSM\|pathological\|mental illness" src/
```

If any found:
- Replace with descriptive equivalent
- "depression" -> "low mood" or "feeling down"
- "anxiety disorder" -> "high anxiety" or "stress-prone"
- "diagnosis" -> remove entirely (not relevant to this prototype)

Also audit:
- Archetype descriptions in archetypes.ts
- Talent descriptions in talents.ts
- Activity descriptions in activities.ts
- Any tooltips or help text

Report findings in summary even if nothing found.

`grep -rn "depression\|disorder\|diagnosis\|symptom\|treatment\|clinical\|DSM\|pathological" src/` returns no matches

  <name>Task 2: UI consistency polish</name>
  <files>src/App.tsx, src/components/*.tsx</files>
  <action>
Review and polish for consistency:

1. **Spacing consistency:**
   - All panels use consistent padding (p-4)
   - Consistent margins between sections (mt-6 or gap-6)
   - Card spacing consistent within panels

2. **Typography consistency:**
   - Section headers: text-lg font-bold or text-sm font-semibold
   - Body text: default size
   - Muted text: text-base-content/70 or text-base-content/50
   - Labels: text-xs

3. **Color consistency:**
   - Resource colors follow existing pattern (70+ success, 30-70 warning, <30 error)
   - Domain colors consistent across skills and activities
   - Badges use DaisyUI semantic classes

4. **Component structure:**
   - All panels have clear headers
   - Collapsible sections use same `<details>` pattern
   - Dev Tools organized with dividers

Make minimal changes - this is polish, not redesign. If something is already consistent, leave it.

Document any changes made.

Visual inspection: Run `npm run dev` and scan all panels for visual consistency.

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 6 integration:
- DevToolsPanel with balance parameters and archetype selection
- 6 preset archetypes covering Big Five extremes
- Side-by-side comparison mode
- No clinical labels in UI
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173

**OBSV-01: Dashboard at a glance**
- [ ] CharacterPanel shows personality radar, capacities radar, and resources
- [ ] Main area shows skills, activities, talents
- [ ] All visible without scrolling (or minimal scroll)

**OBSV-02: Activity observation**
- [ ] Start simulation (speed 2x+)
- [ ] Enqueue an activity
- [ ] Observe activity progress and completion toast
- [ ] Observe resources draining
- [ ] Let overskudd get low, observe activity failure

**OBSV-03: Emergence validation (CRITICAL)**
- [ ] Click "Compare Mode" button
- [ ] Select "Hermit vs Social Butterfly"
- [ ] Start simulation at 5x speed
- [ ] Watch for 30+ seconds
- [ ] Verify: Hermit's social battery drains faster
- [ ] Verify: Social Butterfly's mood stays higher
- [ ] Verify: Hermit accumulates more stress
- [ ] The two characters behave VISIBLY DIFFERENTLY

**OBSV-04: No labels**
- [ ] Scan all text in UI
- [ ] No "depression", "anxiety disorder", "diagnosis", etc.
- [ ] Only descriptive language ("stressed", "low energy", "drained")
- [ ] Big Five names visible (that's fine)

**Dev Tools verification:**
- [ ] Open Dev Tools panel
- [ ] Adjust a balance parameter
- [ ] Click Reset - values return to defaults
- [ ] Select an archetype - character changes
- [ ] Click Randomize - random personality generated

Type "approved" if all checks pass.
If issues found, describe what failed and I'll fix before completing.

1. No clinical/DSM terms in codebase
2. UI visually consistent
3. Human verification confirms all OBSV requirements met

<success_criteria>
- OBSV-01: Dashboard shows all systems at a glance
- OBSV-02: Activity success/failure observable
- OBSV-03: Different personalities produce different behaviors
- OBSV-04: No diagnostic labels, pure emergence
- Phase 6 complete
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-integration-observation/06-04-SUMMARY.md`

Then update `.planning/STATE.md` to mark Phase 6 complete (project complete!)
