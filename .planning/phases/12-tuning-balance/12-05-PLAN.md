<objective>
Human verification of all Phase 12 tuning and balance tools.

Purpose: Validate that calculation traces, config persistence, headless simulation, and personality differentiation all work correctly.
Output: Verified phase with any bug fixes applied.

Phase 12 Tuning & Balance tools:
1. CalculationTracePanel - expandable formula breakdowns for derived stats and action resources
2. Balance config localStorage persistence with preset save/load
3. Extended DevToolsPanel with all nested config fields
4. TelemetryStore capturing simulation data over time
5. Headless simulation runner with async yielding
6. SimulationRunnerPanel for test controls
7. TelemetryChartsPanel with Recharts visualization
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**1. Calculation Trace Overlay (Success Criteria 1)**
- Open app at http://localhost:5173
- Expand "Calculation Trace" panel in CharacterPanel
- Verify Overskudd shows: value, formula with weights, input values, computed result
- Click "Where does Mood come from?" - verify nested breakdown expands
- Click "Refresh" button - verify values update
- Let simulation run, click Refresh again - verify values changed

**2. Balance Config Persistence (Success Criteria 2)**
- Open DevToolsPanel
- Expand "Needs Config" section
- Change hungerDecayRate from 0.8 to 1.5
- Refresh page (F5)
- Verify hungerDecayRate is still 1.5 (persisted)
- Click "Reset All to Defaults"
- Verify hungerDecayRate is back to 0.8

**3. Preset System**
- Change several balance values
- Enter preset name "fast-decay" and click "Save Current"
- Reset to defaults
- Select "fast-decay" from dropdown and click "Load"
- Verify your changes are restored

**4. 7-Day Autonomous Simulation (Success Criteria 3)**
- Expand "Balance Testing Tools" panel
- Select "7 days" duration
- Select "Current" personality
- Click "Run Simulation"
- Verify progress updates without UI freezing
- After completion, check results:
  - Survival rate should be > 90%
  - No need should have minimum below ~10%
  - Avg mood should be > 40

**5. Personality Differentiation (Success Criteria 4)**
- Click "Run Comparison" button
- Wait for both introvert and extrovert simulations
- In TelemetryChartsPanel, view both runs
- Verify observable differences:
  - Introvert should show higher socialBattery during solo activities
  - Extrovert should show lower socialBattery when alone
  - Different activity patterns visible in critical events

**6. No Spam Strategy (Success Criteria 5)**
- Observe the AI decision patterns in telemetry
- Check if any single activity dominates (e.g., eating 80% of the time)
- Verify variety of activities chosen based on needs

Report any issues found.
