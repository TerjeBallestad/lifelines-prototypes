<objective>
Human verification of Phase 8 Derived Wellbeing system.

Purpose: Validate that Mood, Purpose, and Nutrition behave as designed. Verify curve-based mood computation prevents death spirals, personality affects purpose equilibrium, and visual feedback communicates system state clearly to the player.

Output: Verification that all Phase 8 success criteria are met.

Phase 8: Derived Wellbeing system

- Mood computed from primary needs via sigmoid curves with floor/ceiling
- Mood displayed as emoji (sad/neutral/content/happy) with tooltip breakdown
- Purpose with personality-based equilibrium (Conscientiousness + Openness)
- Nutrition as slow-moving stat (affects Energy regen and Mood baseline)
- DerivedStatsSection in NeedsPanel with visual separator
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Setup:**
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173
2. Enable "v1.1 Needs" toggle in simulation controls
3. Start simulation

**Test 1: Mood Responds to Needs (WELL-01)**
1. Observe Mood emoji in Derived Wellbeing section
2. Let simulation run until some needs decay
3. Hover over Mood emoji to see breakdown tooltip
4. EXPECTED: Tooltip shows individual need contributions (Hunger: -X, Energy: -Y, etc.)
5. EXPECTED: Mood emoji changes as needs decay (starts content, may become neutral/sad)

**Test 2: Mood Floor Prevents Death Spiral (WELL-02)**
1. Let simulation run until Hunger reaches critical (~10-15%)
2. Observe Mood value
3. EXPECTED: Mood is degraded but NOT collapsed to 0
4. EXPECTED: Mood stays above floor (10%) even with critical needs
5. Hover tooltip should show Hunger contributing large negative value

**Test 3: Purpose Equilibrium (WELL-03 partial)**
1. Observe Purpose bar and equilibrium indicator
2. Adjust personality traits via dev sliders (Personality section)
3. Increase Conscientiousness to 80+
4. EXPECTED: Purpose equilibrium increases (higher baseline for conscientious characters)
5. Increase Openness to 80+
6. EXPECTED: Purpose equilibrium increases further

**Test 4: Nutrition Slow Change (NEED-06 partial)**
1. Observe Nutrition bar in Derived Wellbeing section
2. Let simulation run for 30+ seconds
3. EXPECTED: Nutrition changes very slowly (almost imperceptibly)
4. EXPECTED: Label shows "changes slowly based on diet"

**Test 5: Visual Feedback Quality**
1. Check visual separator between Primary Needs and Derived Wellbeing
2. Check Mood emoji is clear and readable
3. Check Purpose shows equilibrium marker
4. EXPECTED: Clear visual hierarchy, player can quickly understand system

**Note:** Tests for "Purpose from meaningful activities" (WELL-03 full) and "Low Purpose affects Overskudd" (WELL-04) require Phase 9-10 integration and will be verified in later phases.

<verification>
Human verification of Phase 8 success criteria per ROADMAP.md:
1. Patient Mood updates automatically as primary needs change
2. Patient with critical Hunger shows degraded Mood, but floor prevents collapse
3. Purpose equilibrium varies by personality (Conscientiousness + Openness)
4. Nutrition changes slowly based on diet
5. Clear visual feedback in NeedsPanel
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 5 verification tests pass
- Human confirms derived stats behave as designed
- No visual or usability issues reported
</success_criteria>
