<objective>
Verify v1.0 removal is complete and v1.1 system works

Purpose: Human verification that the cleanup was successful and the game functions correctly with only the v1.1 needs-based system.

Output: Verified working game state, phase complete.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete removal of v1.0 resource system. The game now runs exclusively on the v1.1 needs-based system (Primary Needs -> Derived Wellbeing -> Action Resources).</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start fresh: `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000

2. **Verify UI cleanup:**
   - SimulationControls should NOT show "v1.1 Needs" toggle checkbox
   - CharacterPanel should show "Needs" section (not "Resources")
   - No old-style resource bars (flat energy/mood/overskudd gauges)

3. **Verify character displays correctly:**
   - Primary Needs section visible (Hunger, Energy, Hygiene, Bladder, Social, Fun, Security)
   - Derived Wellbeing section visible (Mood emoji, Purpose bar, Nutrition bar)
   - Action Resources section visible (Overskudd, socialBattery, Focus, Willpower)

4. **Verify activities work:**
   - Click an activity card (e.g., "Eating a Meal")
   - Activity should queue and start executing
   - Needs should restore as activity progresses (Hunger goes up for eating)
   - Action resources should drain based on difficulty
   - Activity should complete with toast notification

5. **Verify simulation runs:**
   - Click play button
   - Needs should decay over time
   - Mood should respond to need changes
   - Overskudd should respond to mood/energy/purpose

6. **Check browser console:**
   - No runtime errors (TypeError, undefined property access, etc.)
   - No warnings about missing properties

Expected state: Game functions exactly as it did before, but without the v1.0/v1.1 toggle complexity.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if everything works correctly, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
</task>

<verification>
Phase 10.1 is complete when human verification confirms:
- No v1.0 UI elements visible
- Character initializes with all v1.1 properties
- Activities execute correctly with need restoration
- Simulation runs without errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Fresh game starts and runs without errors
- All v1.1 UI elements display correctly
- Activities function as expected
- No console errors or warnings related to removed v1.0 code
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10.1-remove-v1-resources/10.1-03-SUMMARY.md`
