# Phase 10.1 Plan 03: Human Verification Summary

**Verified complete removal of v1.0 resource system**

## Verification Results

All verification criteria passed:

- CharacterPanel shows "Needs" section (not "Resources")
- No old-style resource bars visible

✅ **Character Displays Correctly:**
- Primary Needs section visible (Hunger, Energy, Hygiene, Bladder, Social, Fun, Security)
- Derived Wellbeing section visible (Mood emoji, Purpose bar, Nutrition bar)
- Action Resources section visible (Overskudd, socialBattery, Focus, Willpower)

✅ **Activities Work:**
- Activities queue and execute correctly
- Needs restore during activity execution
- Action resources drain based on difficulty
- Activities complete with toast notification

✅ **Simulation Runs:**
- Play button starts simulation
- Needs decay over time
- Mood responds to need changes
- Overskudd responds to mood/energy/purpose

✅ **Console Clean:**
- No runtime errors
- No warnings about missing properties

## Additional Fixes During Verification

Orchestrator fixed remaining v1.0 references discovered during verification:

1. **CharacterPanel.tsx** - Removed `isOverstressed` badge (stress was v1.0 only)
2. **CharacterCard.tsx** - Updated to use v1.1 needs/actionResources instead of resources
3. **TalentsPanel.tsx** - Removed `resourceModifierBreakdown` section
4. **ActivityQueue.tsx** - Removed `threshold` DurationMode case
5. **Character.ts** - Removed unused modifiers imports
6. **CharacterStore.ts** - Removed `defaultResources` import and usage
7. **archetypes.ts** - Removed `defaultResources` import and usage

## Phase 10.1 Complete

The v1.0 resource system has been completely removed. The game now runs exclusively on the v1.1 needs-based system:

- **Primary Needs** (7): Hunger, Energy, Hygiene, Bladder, Social, Fun, Security
- **Derived Wellbeing** (2): Mood, Purpose (+ Nutrition health stat)
- **Action Resources** (4): Overskudd, socialBattery, Focus, Willpower

All code paths, types, and UI components have been cleaned up. No v1.0 remnants remain.
